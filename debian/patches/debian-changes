subject: Collected Debian patches for qjoypad
Author: Marco Amadori <marco.amadori@gmail.com>

The qjoypad package is maintained in Git rather than maintaining
patches as separate files, and separating the patches doesn't seem
to be worth the effort.  They are therefore all included in this
single Debian patch.

For full commit history and separated commits, see the packaging Git
repository.

+Chapter 2. Getting Started
+
+2.1. Requirements
+
+     - A Linux computer and a Linux-compatible gaming device
+     - A Linux kernel with joystick support (see the Linux Kernel
+       HOWTO  [http://www.linuxdocs.org/HOWTOs/Kernel-HOWTO.html]
+       and the Linux joystick driver website
+       http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~vojtech/joystick/)
+     - XWindows (see www.xfree86.org)
+     - Trolltech's QT (see www.trolltech.com)
+     _________________________________________________________
+
+2.2. Installation
+
+   Installing QJoyPad should be a quick and painless process. The
+   basic procedure is:
+
+   ./config
+   make
+   make install
+
+   however,  there  are  some  settings  that  might  need  to be
+   changed.
+
+    1. Device  directory:  By  default,  QJoyPad  will  look  for
+       joystick  devices  in  /dev/input, but if your system puts
+       them  somewhere else, you'll need to run ./config with the
+       argument  --devdir=DIR,  where  DIR is where your joystick
+       devices reside. For instance, if your joystick devices are
+       /dev/js0, /dev/js1, etc., instead of running ./config, run
+       ./config --devdir="/dev"
+    2. Install  directory:  By default, QJoyPad will try to put a
+       copy   of   itself   in   /usr/local/bin,  some  icons  in
+       /usr/local/share/pixmaps,     and     this    readme    in
+       /usr/local/doc/qjoypad3 so that they will be accessible to
+       all  users.  If you want these files to go somewhere other
+       than  /usr/local (or if you don't have permission to write
+       to   /usr/local),   you'll   need  to  pass  the  argument
+       --prefix=DIR  to  ./config.  For example, if you wanted to
+       install  QJoyPad just for yourself in your home directory,
+       you  could  run  ./config --prefix="/home/user" instead of
+       ./config.
+    3. Use  Plain  Keys:  Normally,  QJoyPad doesn't use standard
+       XWindows  key names to describe your keyboard, but instead
+       uses  names  that  look nicer and are easier to recognize.
+       For   instance,   instead   of  "KP_Begin",  "Prior",  and
+       "Shift_L", QJoyPad uses "KP 5", "PageDown", and "L Shift".
+       If  you  think  generating  these  names  is  a  waste  of
+       processor  power, or if you don't think you're getting the
+       right  name for the key you're pressing, pass the argument
+       --plain_keys  to  ./config  and  QJoyPad will just use the
+       XWindows default names.
+
+   Of course, you can mix use as many of these options at once as
+   you    like.    For    instance    ./config    --devdir="/dev"
+   --prefix="/home/user" is completely valid.
