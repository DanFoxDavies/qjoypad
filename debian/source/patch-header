subject: Collected Debian patches for qjoypad
Author: Marco Amadori <marco.amadori@gmail.com>

The qjoypad package is maintained in Git rather than maintaining
patches as separate files, and separating the patches doesn't seem
to be worth the effort.  They are therefore all included in this
single Debian patch.

For full commit history and separated commits, see the packaging Git
repository.
